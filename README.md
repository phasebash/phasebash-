Overview
========
Phasebash~ is a collection of low-level abstractions which enable the development of 
more complicated patches using vanilla Puredata. The goal is to cleanly extend and lift
Puredata patches into the modern world with more useful paradigms not explicitly provided
by the core Puredata object library.  Important gaps include:

- Dynamic graph creation
- Functional programming
- Databinding
- API declaration and definition
- Collection operations
- Widgets

Installation
------------
Add the 'abstractions' folder to your Pd PATH either using the Pd gui or commandline options.

TODO
----
1. Useful documentation and help patches.
2. Separation of DSP from library objects.
