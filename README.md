Overview
========
Phasebash~ is a collection of abstractions which enable the development of 
more concise patches using vanilla PureData. The goal is to cleanly extend and lift
Puredata patches with more expressive paradigms not explicitly provided
by the core PureData object library.  These functions include:

- Dynamic graph creation
- Functional programming
- Databinding
- Sequencing primitives
- Graphic sequence components

Installation
------------
Add the 'abstractions' folder to your Pd PATH either using the Pd gui or commandline options.

TODO
----
1. Useful documentation and help patches.
2. Separation of DSP from library objects.
